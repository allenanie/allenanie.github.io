title: A Brief History of RNN Encoder Decoder
layout: post
---


RNN encoder-decoder has become the next heated field in Natural Language Processing, here is a history of its development. Papers are organized in a timely manner.

Ian Goodfellow's book has a great overall summary to it: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/rnn.html
but sadly since it is a book, it lacks any recent development and any technical details.

RNN encoder-decoder network was started by Kyunghyun Cho (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf) and Ilya Sutskever (http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf) both in 2014.

Sutskever's model constitutes end-to-end (sequence-to-sequence) training (with pure RNN), while Cho's model relies on scoring proposals generated by another machien translation system.
