I attended this year's NIPS. It is unbelievably close to me (Long Beach is 1 flight hour away from Palo Alto California), and everything is very affordable compared to the ridiculously priced everything in NorCal.



The conference lasted 6 days. Monday is for tutorials, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday morning are main conferences, Thursday afternoon is Symposia, and Friday - Saturday are workshops. Surprisingly (or not surprisingly) the quality of each event is not uniform. I found the symposia and Friday's workshop rather dull, but Tuesday's main conference, as well as Saturday's workshop to be most exciting.



I will not attempt to summarize "themes" of this conference, because each attendee is just a sampler with their own priors. I'm definitely not a HMC with a learned neural network jump function[^1].  However, I will point out some interesting posters/talks that I was lucky enough to sample.



The drama at this year's NIPS started from Ali Rahimi and Yann LeCun's over-the-Twitter debate. If you haven't caught this on Twitter,
