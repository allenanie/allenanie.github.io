I decide to have a series of introductions for cutting edge papers. Those papaers are posted on Archive site like [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/). I recently subscribed to them. 

I will list those articles also based on themes, or relevancy, or (fancier) timelines. I won't discuss in great detail the content of the paper, but I'll leave my cursory comments.
