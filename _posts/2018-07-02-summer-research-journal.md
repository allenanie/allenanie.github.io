## Project Outlines

Insights/Problems from DeepTag Projects: 

It is a **perfect test bed for a few unsupervised learning algorithms** in NLP and see which one actually works well in an industry setting.

1. **Unsupervised LM** in medical domain to improve downstream supervised learning tasks. (LM gives both word embedding and a sentence model) (Can fix LM or unfix during domain fitting)
2. **Word embedding** training only (fixed embedding) (on large corpora)
3. **Meta-learning** the LSTM optimizer, apply to see if it improves and make test domain shift smaller.
