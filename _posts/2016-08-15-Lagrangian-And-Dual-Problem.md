title: A Geometric Understanding of Lagrangian and Dual Problem
---
This is an article providing another perspective on understanding Lagrangian and dual problem. These two topics are essential to convex and non-convex optimization. Since it is a blog post, the proper background to understand this article is kept rather low. If you need to brush up on convex knowledge, or wish to be introduced to the subject, there is a handout from Stanford CS229 website, and it's written in a very concise and clear way: [Convex Optimization (I)](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-cvxopt.pdf) and [Convex Optimization (II)](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-cvxopt2.pdf). However, you don't need to understand convex sets, functions in order to follow this post. If you are like me, who took Stanford EE364A, then you might find this post quite fascinating.
