As some of you might know, I've been working on Numpy and Theano for a while. I can't claim any expertise, but have found many interesting facets and had to synthesize them together, leading to this post.

As always, you'll find a list of references (website links) at the bottom of this page.

## Numpy Slicing

The normal kind of slicing can be found here: [Numpy Array](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
And it's somewhat understandable.
