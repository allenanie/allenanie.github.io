### Author

I'm currently a second year Symbolic Systems master student at Stanford University. My main area is Natural Language Processing, but I work in other areas such as deep reinforcement learning, applied machine learning, information theory as well.

I spent a year in Andrew Ng's Stanford Machine Learning Group working on recurrent neural network regularizations, data augmentation, and sequence-to-sequence generative models. 

I recently accepted the offer to become a full-time engineering research scientist at Stanford Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Data Science Department to work with James Zou. I also do consulting work at a newly founded startup (hey, they are still in stealth!). 

Anyway, if you have cool ideas or need advice, send me an email!
